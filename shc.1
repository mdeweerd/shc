.SH NAME
shc \- Generic shell script compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]shc\f[R] [ \-e \f[I]DATE\f[R] ] [ \-m \f[I]MESSAGE\f[R] ] [ \-i
\f[I]IOPT\f[R] ] [ \-x \f[I]CMD\f[R] ] [ \-l \f[I]LOPT\f[R] ] [ \-o
\f[I]OUTFILE\f[R] ] [ \-2ABCDHpPSUhrv ] \-f \f[I]SCRIPT\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]shc\f[R] creates a stripped binary executable version of the script
specified with \f[CR]\-f\f[R] on the command line.
.PP
The binary version will get a \f[CR].x\f[R] extension appended by
default if \f[I]OUTFILE\f[R] is not defined with [\-o \f[I]OUTFILE\f[R]]
option and will usually be a bit larger in size than the original ascii
code.
Generated C source code is saved in a file with the extension
\f[CR].x.c\f[R] or in a file specified with appropriate option.
.PP
If you provide an expiration DATE with the \f[CR]\-e\f[R] option, the
compiled binary will refuse to run after the date specified.
The message \f[B]Please contact your provider\f[R] will be displayed
instead.
This message can be changed with the \f[CR]\-m\f[R] option.
.PP
You can compile any kind of shell script, but you need to supply valid
\f[CR]\-i\f[R], \f[CR]\-x\f[R] and \f[CR]\-l\f[R] options.
.PP
The compiled binary will still require the shell specified in the first
line of the shell code (i.e.\ \f[CR]#!/bin/sh\f[R]) to be available on
the system, therefore \f[B]shc\f[R] does not create completely
independent binaries, it mainly obfuscates the source script.
.PP
\f[B]shc\f[R] itself is not a compiler such as cc, it rather encodes and
encrypts a shell script and generates C source code with the added
expiration capability.
It then uses the system compiler to compile a stripped binary which
behaves exactly like the original script.
Upon execution, the compiled binary will decrypt and execute the code
with the shell \f[CR]\-c\f[R] option.
It will not give you any speed improvement as a real C program would.
.PP
\f[B]shc\f[R]\[cq]s main purpose is to protect your shell scripts from
modification or inspection.
You can use it if you wish to distribute your scripts but don\[cq]t want
them to be easily readable by other people.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-e \f[I]DATE\f[R]
Expiration date in \f[I]dd/mm/yyyy\f[R] format \f[CR][none]\f[R]
.TP
\-m \f[I]MESSAGE\f[R]
message to display upon expiration
\f[CR][\[dq]Please contact your provider\[dq]]\f[R]
.TP
\-f \f[I]SCRIPT\f[R]
File path of the script to compile
.TP
\-P
Use a pipe to feed the script, with ARGV fixes.
Enabled automatically for \f[CR]python\f[R], \f[CR]perl\f[R] and
\f[CR]csh\f[R].
.TP
\-p
Use a pipe to feed the script, without ARGV fixing.
.TP
\-i \f[I]IOPT\f[R]
Inline option for the shell interpreter i.e: \f[CR]\-e\f[R]
.TP
\-x \f[I]CMD\f[R]
eXec command, as a printf format i.e:
\f[CR]exec(\[rs]\[rs]\[aq]%s\[rs]\[rs]\[aq],\[at]ARGV);\f[R]
.TP
\-l \f[I]LOPT\f[R]
Last shell option i.e: \f[CR]\-\-\f[R]
.TP
\-o \f[I]OUTFILE\f[R]
output to the file specified by OUTFILE
.TP
\-r
Relax security.
Make a redistributable binary which executes on different systems
running the same operating system.
You can release your binary with this option for others to use
.TP
\-v
Verbose compilation
.TP
\-S
Enable setuid for root callable programs
.TP
\-D
Enable debug (show exec calls, etc.)
.TP
\-U
Make binary execution untraceable (using \f[I]strace\f[R],
\f[I]ptrace\f[R], \f[I]truss\f[R], etc.)
.TP
\-H
Hardening.
Extra security flag without root access requirement that protects
against dumping, code injection, \f[CR]cat /proc/pid/cmdline\f[R],
\f[CR]ptrace\f[R], etc\&...
This feature is \f[B]experimental\f[R] and may not work on all systems.
it requires bourne shell (sh) scripts
.TP
\-C
Display license and exit
.TP
\-A
Display abstract and exit
.TP
\-2
Use \f[CR]mmap2\f[R] system call.
.TP
\-B
Compile for BusyBox
.TP
\-h
Display help and exit
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
These can be used to provide options to the GCC Compiler.
Examples: static compilation, machine architecture, sanitize options.
.TP
CC
C compiler command \f[CR][cc]\f[R]
.TP
CFLAGS
C compiler flags \f[CR][none]\f[R]
.TP
LDFLAGS
Linker flags \f[CR][none]\f[R]
.SH EXAMPLES
Compile a script which can be run on other systems with the trace option
enabled (without \f[CR]\-U\f[R] flag):
.IP
.EX
shc \-f myscript \-o mybinary
.EE
.PP
Compile an untraceable binary:
.IP
.EX
shc \-Uf myscript \-o mybinary
.EE
.PP
Compile an untraceable binary that doesn\[cq]t require root access
(experimental):
.IP
.EX
shc \-Hf myscript \-o mybinary
.EE
.SH LIMITATIONS
The maximum size of the script that could be executed once compiled is
limited by the operating system configuration parameter
\f[CR]_SC_ARG_MAX\f[R] (see sysconf(2))
